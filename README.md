### Hi!

I like coding, reading books and learning how to collaborate with others effectively.

Check out [my website](https://mejulian.dev) to learn a bit more about me and my projects.

You could also read [one of my articles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-junior-dev-can-learn-from-40-year-old-mistakes-julian-edwards-3p2kc) to get a better idea of how I think.
